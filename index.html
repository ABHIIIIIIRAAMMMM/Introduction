        <h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>My hobbies are reading a book, playing outside and building jenga blocks and coding. Coding intrests me 
            because you get to learn new things and learn how to solve problems. building jenga blocks is fun because 
            I get build all sorts of different structures using my imagination. Reading books is fun because stories are action
            packed and it is timepass too whenever you are bored.
